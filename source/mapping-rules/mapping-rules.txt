A mapping rule specifies where data from each relational table should be
migrated to and how the columns should be mapped to fields in 
MongoDB documents. Mapping rules are created inside a project after you have provided a 
valid :ref:`relational database connection string and credentials <rm-relational-database-connection-strings>`.

MongoDB Schema Design Patterns
------------------------------

Schema design patterns in MongoDB shape how data is organized, accessed, and 
queried. Your schema design influences the performance and 
scalability of your MongoDB deployment. Good schema design practices 
ensure efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of your data. 
Relational Migrator allows you to make key decisions such as combining 
multiple tables into a single collection or embedding data in your documents.

For an overview of schema design best practices review the following 
documentation:

- :ref:`data-modeling-patterns`.

- `Building with Patterns
  <https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/building-with-patterns-a-summary>`__.

- `Summary of Schema Design Anti-Patterns and How to Spot Them
  <https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/mongodb/schema-design-anti-pattern-summary/>`__.

Mapping Direction Preference
----------------------------

The source relational model is static and unchanging while the target MongoDB model
is dynamic and customizable.

You can create a mapping rule based on a source :ref:`relational model <create-rule-relational>`
or based on a destination :ref:`MongoDB model <create-rule-mongodb>`.

Relationships
-------------

Mapping rules help define a ``one-to-one``, ``one-to-many``, or ``many-to-many`` 
relationship between your tables and collections.

You can define mapping rules for the following configurations: 

- A single table that maps to a single MongoDB collection. 

- A single table that maps to multiple MongoDB collections. 

- Multiple tables that map into a single collection.

Default Rules
-------------

Relational Migrator automatically creates a :ref:`New Documents mapping rule <rm-new-documents>`
for each source table. This initial rule produces a MongoDB schema that
is identical to the relational database. You can edit the initial rule 
before running any data migration jobs.

Data Type Detection
-------------------

Relational Migrator automatically selects the best MongoDB data type for each 
source column.

For example, SQL Server source data of types ``text``, ``varchar``,
``nvarchar`` or ``char``  will become the MongoDB ``string`` data type.

Migrate as Options
------------------

Mapping rules can be defined with the following ``Migrate as`` options:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Option
     - Behavior

   * - :ref:`Migrate rows as New Documents <rm-new-documents>`
     - Translates each relational database row to a new document.

   * - :ref:`Migrate rows as Embedded array <rm-embedded-array>`
     - Translates each row into an array element within a parent document identified by a foreign key   
       relationship.

   * - :ref:`Migrate rows as Embedded documents <rm-embedded-documents>`
     - Translates each row as a set of fields or an embedded object in a child document identified by a foreign key relationship.
