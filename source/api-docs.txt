The Relational Migrator REST API provides you with programmatic access 
to Relation Migrator with HTTPS endpoints. The REST API is a middleware 
service that sits between your application and your source and destination 
databases that you can send requests to facilitate and manage your sync 
jobs.

You don't need to install any additional extensions or packages to use 
the Relation Migrator REST API. The functionality is built into the core 
Relational Migrator product and runs on the same port that you access 
the application on (either ``8278``, ``8080``, or ``443``).

How the REST API Works
----------------------

The Relational Migrator REST API:

- Runs on the machine or server that the Relation Migrator application
  is installed on.
- The Rest API is governed by the host adapter binding.
- The Relational Migrator REST API **does not** currently support 
  authentication.

When to Use REST API
--------------------

We recommend using the Relational Migrator REST API when:

- You want to use a task scheduler such as 
  `CRON <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron>`__ and define dynamic 
  :ref:`table filters <rm-table-filters>` within a project such as 
  ``WHERE DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), last_modified) <= 1`` to batch migrate 
  data on a cadence from your relational database to MongoDB. 

- You want to programmatically create Relational Migrator sync jobs 
  quickly and dynamically. For example, using connection strings from 
  multiple databases without manually configuring them in the GUI.

- You generally prefer scripting your workflows instead of using a GUI.
