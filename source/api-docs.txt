The Data API is a managed service that lets you securely work with data
stored in Atlas using standard HTTPS requests. The Data API is not a
direct connection to your database. Instead, the API is a fully-managed
middleware service that sits between your cluster and the clients that
send requests.

You can use the Data API to connect to MongoDB Atlas from any platform
that supports HTTPS, including:

- Web browsers
- Web servers
- CI/CD pipelines
- Serverless & Edge compute environments
- Mobile applications
- Internet-Of-Things devices

You don't need to install any database drivers or opinionated libraries
to work with the Data API. Instead, you send standard HTTPS requests
like the following:

Endpoints
---------

The Data API supports two types of endpoints:

- **Data API Endpoints** are automatically generated endpoints that each
  represent a MongoDB operation. You can use the endpoints to create,
  read, update, delete, and aggregate documents in a MongoDB data
  source.

  To learn more, including how to set up and call endpoints, see
  :ref:`Data API Endpoints <data-api-endpoints>`.

How the Data API Works
----------------------

Data API requests may resemble traditional database operations, like
``find`` or ``insertOne``, but the Data API is not a direct connection
to your database. Instead, the Data API adds additional authentication,
authorization, and correctness checks to ensure that your data is only
accessed or modified in the ways you allow. This allows you to safely
access data in Atlas from potentially vulnerable clients like web apps.

For each incoming request, the Data API:

1. **Authenticates the calling user.** This might involve validating an
   access token, logging in with header credentials, or directly
   assigning a specific runtime user based on your configuration.

2. **Authorizes the request.** This ensures that the user sent a
   well-formed request and has permission to perform the requested
   operation based on your endpoint authorization scheme.

3. **Runs the requested operation.** This might involve reading or
   writing data in Atlas with a generated endpoint or invoke a custom
   function that you wrote.

   For requests that read or write data in Atlas, the Data API also
   enforces the access control rules and document schemas defined in
   your App. This means that users can only access data they're allowed
   to read and write. Requests fail if they include an invalid write
   operation.

4. **Returns an HTTPS response to the caller.** The response includes
   the result of a generated endpoint operation or any data that you
   return from a custom endpoint. In the request, you can choose to receive the
   response in either :ref:`JSON or EJSON format
   <data-api-data-formats>`.

When to Use the Data API
------------------------

For server applications, and especially for high-load and latency
sensitive use-cases, we recommend connecting directly to Atlas with a
MongoDB driver. Operations called through a Data API endpoint take
longer to complete than the corresponding MongoDB operations called
through a driver. Additionally, the drivers provide more flexibility and
control over how your operations are executed. To learn more, visit the
:driver:`MongoDB Drivers </>` documentation.

We recommend using the Data API when:

- You want to run MongoDB operations from a web application or other
  client that you can't trust.

- You can't or don't want to manage a MongoDB driver in your server-side
  environment. For example, some edge compute environments don't support
  database drivers or connection pooling.

- You want to develop a new feature and prefer a flexible solution for
  working on the client side first before later creating and refining
  the API layer.

- You want to integrate Atlas data access into a federated API gateway.

- You want to connect to App Services from an environment not currently
  supported by an Atlas Device SDK and don't want to use a driver to connect
  over the :ref:`wire protocol <wire-protocol>`.


Constraints
-----------

The following constraints apply to Data API requests and responses: 

- Requests will time out after 300 seconds of runtime.

- Data API response payloads are limited to 350 MB in size.
