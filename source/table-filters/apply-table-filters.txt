===================
Apply Table Filters
===================


You can use table filters to migrate specific subsets of your table data.
Table filters allow you to apply SQL where and row limit clauses
when pulling data from your table.

Before You Begin
----------------

Table filters are applied while you are creating mapping rules. See 
:ref:`<rm-create-mapping-rules>` for more details.

You can apply one filter per table. Each filter can have a SQL where 
clause, a row limit clause, or both.

Steps
-----


#. From the ``Schema model`` pane, click the table that you want to apply a filter to.
#. On the ``Filter on`` section in the edit mapping rule pane, click ``+ Add``.
#. Under the ``SQLquery`` header, enter a SQL where criteria. The SQL you specify must be ANSI SQL compliant with your relational database.
   The following are examples of SQL where clauses used to apply ``SQLQuery`` table filters:

   .. code-block:: SQL

      LASTNAME LIKE '%SMITH%'
      LASTNAME = 'SMITH'
      LASTNAME IN('SMITH')
      LASTNAME IN(SELECT LASTNAME FROM ASIA_CUSTOMERS WHERE ID < 100000)
      LASTNAME IN(SELECT LASTNAME FROM ASIA_CUSTOMERS WHERE PAYMENT_DATE >= 05/25/2015)

#. (Optional) Under the ``Row limit`` header, click the ``Limit number of rows`` radio button and enter a value. This applies a limit clause at the end of your SQL query.
#. Click ``Save and close``.
