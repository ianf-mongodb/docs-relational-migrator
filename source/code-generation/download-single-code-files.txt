Download Single Code Files
==========================

Code Generation is a feature built into Relational Migrator that helps
automatically generate code files for your applications connected 
to MongoDB. This page details how to generate and download individual code files.

About this Task
---------------

Some templates also generate additional files which are not specific to a MongoDB collection. These files are called ``Support files``. Click the ``Support files`` check box to indicate if you would like these files included in your downloads.

Steps
-----

You can view, download, or copy a single collections code file.

Navigate to the ``Code Generation`` screen, in the left ``Generate code`` pane:


#. Select a ``Language``.
#. Select a ``Template``.
#. Click the MongoDB collection name.
#. A tab displays for each code file. More than one code file per collection may be generated depending on the template. 
#. Click the ``Copy`` or ``Download`` buttons in the target code file to download or copy that files contents.
