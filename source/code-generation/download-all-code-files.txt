Code Generation is a feature built into Relational Migrator that helps
automatically generate code files for your applications connected 
to MongoDB. This page details how to generate and download all code files into a zip file.

About this Task
---------------

Some templates also generate additional files which are not specific to 
a MongoDB collection. These files are called **Support files**. 

Click the **Support files** check box to indicate if you would like 
these files included in your downloads.

Steps
-----

Navigate to the **Code Generation** screen, in the left **Generate code** pane:


#. Select a **Language**.
#. Select a **Template**.
#. Select the MongoDB collections by clicking check box next to the collection name.
#. Click the **Download selected files** button. The selected files download into a zip file 
   to your **Downloads folder**. The zip file has a naming convention of **PROJECTNAME-LANGUAGE-TEMPLATE**.
