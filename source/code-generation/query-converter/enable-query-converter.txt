Task page titles begin with a present-tense action verb. 

A task page begins with a brief introduction summarizing the task, often called 
a short description. The short description briefly explains the task, and  
answers the following questions:

- "What is this task?"

- "What is it used for?"

- "Why do I care?"

This paragraph can include links out to important conceptual information
required for this task.

About this Task

Include important conceptual or behavioral information that's directly relevant 
to the task. If task-related information is extensive, consider a bulleted list 
that contains brief descriptions of important concepts and links to deeper reading.  

Before you Begin

Optional.

An ordered or unordered list of any prerequisites for the task.

Steps

These are the steps to complete the task. 

In some cases, we recomend that you use a stepped content approach. In others, 
a single statement and copyable command or syntax example.  In most cases, it's helpful 
to include an example of what a successful result looks like. It could be a 
brief description, code block, or screenshot.
