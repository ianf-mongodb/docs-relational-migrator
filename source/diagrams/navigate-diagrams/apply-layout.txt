You can apply a preset layout to your diagram to organize its entities.
Use diagram layouts to neatly arrange entities without needing to
manually click and drag them.

When you apply a layout to a diagram, Relational Migrator applies the
layout to both the Relational and MongoDB views. The zoom level is
automatically adjusted to display your chosen layout.

Steps
-----

To apply a layout to a diagram:

#. Click the tree diagram icon at the top of the diagram view.

#. Choose your layout.

Relational Migrator offers three layout options. 
The examples of each layout option are shown in the following tabs:
