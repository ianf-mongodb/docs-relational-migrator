To interact with Relation Migrator, you use a project. A project holds
configuration settings, mapping rules, and migration-specific details.
Within a project, you have the ability to :ref:`import-project`, :ref:`export-project`, 
and :ref:`delete-project`, as well as :ref:`manage the relational model<rm-manage-relational-model>`.

Get Started
-----------

There are multiple options for you to create a project, summarized in the table below:

   * - Project Creation Option
     - Description

   * - :ref:`rm-create-project-live`
     - Provide source and destination connection details and migrate data from a live SQL instance.
   * - :ref:`create-project-schema-file`
     - Export a Data Definition Language (DDL) file from your relational system and import it into Relational Migrator.
   * - :ref:`create-project-sample-schema`
     - Use a predefined sample schema even if you do not have a relational system to connect to.
