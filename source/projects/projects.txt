You interact with Relation Migrator through a project.
A project holds various configuration settings, mapping rules,
and details specific to your migration.

You can :ref:`import-project`, :ref:`rm-export-project`, and 
:ref:`rm-delete-project` projects as well as 
:ref:`rm-manage-relational-model` in your project.
