You can install and run Relational Migrator as a Docker container. By 
running Relational Migrator with Docker you can have an operating 
system agnostic and easy reproducible installation experience. 

Before you Begin
----------------

Install `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/install/>`__

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Pull the MongoDB Docker Image
      
      .. code-block:: sh

         docker pull public.ecr.aws/v4d7k6c9/relational-migrator:latest

   .. step:: Run the Image as a Container

      .. code-block:: sh

         docker run -p 8080:8080 public.ecr.aws/v4d7k6c9/relational-migrator:latest

      The ``-p 8080:8080`` in this command maps the container port to the host port.
      This allows you to connect to Relational Migrator by browsing to a 
      ``localhost:8080``.

      .. note:: Override a Config Setting

         You can override a configuration setting by specifying the 
         configuration setting in the Docker command.

         For example, consider the disabling telemetry with the 
         following command:

         .. code-block:: bash

            docker run -p 8080:8080 -e MIGRATOR_APP_TELEMETRY_ENABLE=false public.ecr.aws/v4d7k6c9/relational-migrator:latest

   .. step:: Check that the Container is Running

      To check the status of your Docker container, run the following 
      command:

      .. code-block:: sh

         docker container ls

      The output from the ``ls`` command lists the following fields that 
      describe the running container:

      - ``Container ID``
      - ``Image``
      - ``Command``
      - ``Created``
      - ``Status``
      - ``Port``
      - ``Names`` 

      .. code-block:: sh
         :copyable: false

         CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                              COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                    NAMES
         82b1f8adca43 public.ecr.aws/v4d7k6c9/relational-migrator:latest   "/opt/mongodb-relatiâ€¦"   46 seconds ago   Up 44 seconds 0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp   pedantic_kirch

   .. step:: Connect to application

      To view the application, navigate to: `<http://localhost:8080>`__.

      .. note::

         If you changed the port number in the previous step, change the
         port in the url above.
