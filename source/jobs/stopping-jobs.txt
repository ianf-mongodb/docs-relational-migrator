Stop a Sync Job
===============

You can stop a sync job from the **Job Overview** pane 
on the **Data Migration** tab.

About this Task
---------------

The effects of stopping a sync job on your destination database depend 
on the type and stage of the sync job:

- If you stop a snapshot sync job during the snapshot stage, any partially migrated data 
  remains in the MongoDB database.

- If you stop a continuous sync job during the CDC stage, the process ends gracefully, 
  and Relational Migrator cleans up any temporary data.

Once initiated, the process of canceling or completing a sync job may take up to one minute.

Steps
-----

To stop your sync job, follow the instructions below based on the current stage of execution:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Stop a Sync Job in Snapshot stage
      :tabid: stop-snapshot

      #. Open the **Data Migration** tab.
      #. Click on the sync job in the **History**  pane.
      #. Click the red **Terminate** button in the upper-right corner of the screen.
      #. Click the red **Terminate** button on the pop-up modal.
         Once a sync job cancels, an **x** icon displays in the **History** pane, 
         and the status of the sync job updates to **Snapshot cancelled**.

   .. tab:: Stop a Sync Job in CDC stage
      :tabid: stop-cdc

      #. Open the **Data Migration** tab.
      #. Click on the sync job in the **History**  pane.
      #. Click the **Complete CDC**  button in the upper-right corner of the screen.
      #. Click the green **Complete CDC** button on the pop-up modal.
         Once the sync job completes, a checkmark icon displays in the **History** pane, all stages display a status of **COMPLETED**, and the status of the sync job updates to **CDC completed**.
