Data Verification
=================

Data verification is a process which is built into the sync engine.
The data verification process uses the source and destination 
connection strings to validate that a sync job was successful.

- Data verification is supported for one-time sync jobs.
- By default, data verification is not performed when running a sync job. 
  You must explicitly opt-in to verification in :guilabel:`Migration Options` 
  before the job is started.
- Enabling data verification can add significant compute time to a sync 
  job.

When data verification is successful, source and destination states match.

- The source relational database row count equals the target collection 
  document count.
- The source relation rows are equivalent to the collection documents.

When data verification is unsuccessful, source and destination states 
do not match.

Data verification does not consider the following when verifying 
destination databases:

- The destination collection contained unrelated data before the sync 
  job started.
- The data in the relational database tables has changed since the sync 
  job was started.
