You can run a sync job with Kafka support, when your sync job is using 
Kafka you have the ability to pause and resume. The amount of 
time that a job can be paused depends on the log retention rate of 
your source relational database.

About this Task
---------------

- This task outlines the pause and resume process for **Kafka** or 
  **Confluent Cloud Kafka** supported sync jobs only. If you are running 
  Relational Migrator without Kafka support you are not able to pause or 
  resume sync jobs.

- Sync jobs using Confluent Cloud Kafka may take additional time to 
  The source connectors must be deployed to faciitate the sync job 
  process. This process typically takes between two to five minutes.

Before you Begin
----------------

- Enable relational migrator for Kafka support, for details see the Kafka
  or Confluent Cloud Kafka install docs. **Todo** add links to the appropriate 
  installation reference pages.

.. procedure::
   :style:  connected

   .. step:: Create a continous sync job
     
      Create a continuous sync job, for details see the 
      :ref:`create a sync job page <rm-create-jobs>`.

   .. step:: Pause the sync job
     
      Wait for the sync job to enter the CDC stage. Once the sync job 
      enters the CDC stage, a :icon-lg:`Pause` :guilabel:`Pause` 
      button displays on the :guilabel:`Job Overview` 
      pane. Click :guilabel:`Pause CDC` on the pop-up modal to confirm.

      The status of the :guilabel:`CDC Stage` updates to 
      :guilabel:`Paused`.

      .. warning::

         You must resume the sync job within your source 
         database's CDC retention period to ensure no events are lost.

   .. step:: Resume the sync job

      To resume a job, click the :icon-lg:`Play` :guilabel:`Resume` 
      button. The status of the CDC stage updates to :guilabel:`Running`
      indicating that Relational Migrator is actively capturing data 
      from the source database.
