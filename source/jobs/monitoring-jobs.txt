==================
Monitor a Sync Job
==================

You can monitor a sync job from the **History** pane on the **Data Migration** tab.
The **History** pane contains in progress, completed, and failed jobs.

About this Task
---------------

Sync jobs execute in a number of distinct stages which are visible on the **Job overview** pane. 

For example:

- A snapshot sync job includes a snapshot stage and, optionally, a verification stage.
- A continuous sync job includes a snapshot stage followed by a CDC stage. 

Job Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~

High-level sync job information displays in the top section of the **Job overview** pane.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Metric
     - Description
   * - Source URI
     - The JDBC connection string used to connect to the source relational database.
   * - Destination URI
     - The MongoDB connection string used to connect to the destination MongoDB database.
   * - Job Mode
     - Indicates if the sync job is snapshot or continuous.
   * - Status
     - Indicates the current or end status of the sync job.


Snapshot Stage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Snapshot stage information displays in the **Snapshot stage** section of the **Job overview** pane.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Metric
     - Description
   * - Snapshot stage status
     - Indicates the status of the snapshot stage.
   * - Started
     - Date and time that the snapshot stage started.
   * - Duration
     - Time taken for the snapshot stage to complete.
   * - Tables migrated
     - Total number of tables migrated from the source database.
   * - Rows migrated
     - Total number of rows migrated from all tables.


CDC stage
~~~~~~~~~

The CDC stage information is displayed in the **CDC stage** section of the **Job overview** pane. The CDC stage begins after the initial snapshot stage has completed and remains in the **RUNNING** status until it is explicitly completed or the sync job encounters an unrecoverable error.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Metric
     - Description
   * - CDC stage status
     - Indicates the status of the CDC stage. When a CDC stage is actively replicating data changes, this status is **RUNNING**.
   * - Started
     - Date and time that Relational Migrator started listening for data change events.
   * - Last event time
     - Latest date and time that Relational Migrator detected a data change event.
   * - Total events seen
     - Number of data change events Relational Migrator has detected since the CDC stage started.
   * - Events in the last hour
     - Number of data change events Relational Migrator has detected in the last hour.


Issues
~~~~~~

If your sync job has errors during execution, you can find the details in the **Issues** pane on the **Data Migration** screen.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Metric
     - Description
   * - Date & Time

     - Total number of errors encountered.
   * - Error detail
     - Detailed error message from the target deployment.
