Connecting Relational Migrator to PostgreSQL requires
`logical decoding 
<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logicaldecoding-explanation.html>`__ 
to be enabled on your PostgreSQL instance. When you set up a new connection, 
Relational Migrator automatically generates the required SQL code to 
configure PostgreSQL. This document explains the purpose of those scripts.

These instructions configure PostgreSQL *for both* Snapshot and 
Continuous sync jobs.

- Snapshot sync jobs migrate all the data and then stop.
- Continuous sync jobs run a snapshot and then enter a CDC stage to 
  continuously replicate data changes.

About this Task
---------------

Relational Migrator uses the PostgreSQL ``pgoutput`` plugin for logical 
decoding. This plug-in is included in PostgreSQL versions 10+, no 
additional installation or configuration is required. 

Before you Begin
----------------

If PostgreSQL is configured as a cluster, Relational Migrator must connect
to the master server.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style: normal


   .. step:: Edit the configuration file 

      Logical replication may not be enabled by default. To enable logical 
      replication, change the `wal_level <https://postgresqlco.nf/doc/en/param/wal_level>`__ 
      configuration in the 
      `postgresql.conf configuration file <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/config-setting.html>`__. 
      You *must restart the database instance* after changing the configuration file. 

      .. code-block:: none

         wal_level = logical 

   .. step:: Create a SQL replication login

      a. Create a PostgreSQL service account user with ``REPLICATION`` 
         and ``LOGIN`` database permissions:

         .. code-block:: sql
            :copyable: true

            CREATE USER RM_SERVICEACCOUNT WITH PASSWORD 'password' REPLICATION LOGIN;

      #. Grant the required ``SELECT`` table and ``USAGE`` 
         schema permissions to the service account:

         .. code-block:: sql
            :copyable: true

            GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA schema_name TO RM_SERVICEACCOUNT;
            GRANT SELECT ON table_name TO RM_SERVICEACCOUNT;

         .. note::

            You must grant ``SELECT`` permissions for each table in the 
            migration.

   .. step:: Create a publication

      Relational Migrator requires you create a 
      `publication <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-publication.html>`__ 
      by running:

      .. code-block:: sql

         CREATE PUBLICATION "migrator_publication" FOR TABLE MYTABLE;

----------

Relational Migrator relies on the open-source Debezium connector to 
capture row-level changes. For more details, see
`Debezium PostgreSQL <https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/postgresql.html>`__.
