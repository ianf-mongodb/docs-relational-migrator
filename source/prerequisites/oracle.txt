To run sync jobs from an Oracle source database, the database may require 
some configuration changes. If Relational Migrator determines the 
database needs configuration changes, it automatically generates a 
SQL script with the required changes. It is recommended to have a 
Database Administrator (DBA) review the commands in this script and 
perform their execution on the database server. The 
Oracle configurations depend on the type of sync job:

:ref:`supported-databases`.

Steps
-----

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Snapshot Jobs
      :tabid: enable-snapshot-jobs

      .. procedure::
         :style: normal

         .. step:: Set up user permissions

            The following code creates a new Oracle service account 
            for Relational Migrator to connect to the Oracle 
            instance. Alternatively, you can use an existing Oracle 
            service account to connect to Relational Migrator with 
            the appropriate permissions.

            a. Create a service account:

                .. code-block:: sql
                    :copyable: true

                    CREATE USER 'user' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

            #. Grant the required permissions to the service account:

                .. code-block:: sql
                   :copyable: true

                   GRANT CREATE SESSION TO user;
                   GRANT SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE TO user;
                   GRANT SELECT ANY TABLE TO user;
                   GRANT SELECT ON V$DATABASE TO user; 

         .. step:: Check if ``LogMiner`` is enabled

            When you connect Relational Migrator to your Oracle database 
            with a new sync :guilabel:`Source Database` connection screen, the tool 
            automatically detects your ``LogMiner`` status and 
            generates the SQL scripts to enable ``LogMiner`` if required. 
            You can check if ``LogMiner`` is enabled with the following 
            query:
            
            .. code-block:: sql
               :copyable: true

                SELECT LOG_MODE FROM V$DATABASE; 

         .. step:: Turn on ``LogMiner`` at the database level
            
            In order to run Snapshot jobs against Oracle, you must enable 
            ``LogMiner`` at the database level. The following code-block
            is an example of automatically-generated code, which you 
            can run manually by substituting your database name:

            .. code-block:: sql
                :copyable: true

                ALTER SYSTEM SET db_recovery_file_dest_size = 10G;
                ALTER SYSTEM SET db_recovery_file_dest = '/opt/oracle/oradata/recovery_area' SCOPE=spfile;
                SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
                STARTUP MOUNT
                ALTER DATABASE ARCHIVELOG;
                ALTER DATABASE OPEN;

   .. tab:: Continuous Jobs
      :tabid: enable-continuous-jobs

      .. procedure::
         :style: normal

        .. step:: Set up user permissions

            The following code creates a new Oracle service account 
            for Relational Migrator to connect to the Oracle 
            instance. Alternatively, you can use an existing Oracle 
            service account to connect to Relational Migrator with 
            the appropriate permissions.

            a. Create a service account:

                .. code-block:: sql
                    :copyable: true

                    CREATE USER 'user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

            #. Grant the required permissions to the service account:

                .. code-block:: sql
                    :copyable: true

                    GRANT SET CONTAINER TO user;
                    GRANT FLASHBACK ANY TABLE TO user;
                    GRANT EXECUTE_CATALOG_ROLE TO user;
                    GRANT SELECT ANY TRANSACTION TO user;
                    GRANT LOGMINING TO user;
                    GRANT CREATE TABLE TO user;
                    GRANT LOCK ANY TABLE TO user;
                    GRANT CREATE SEQUENCE TO user;
                    GRANT SELECT ON DBA_TABLESPACES TO user; GRANT EXECUTE ON DBMS_LOGMNR TO user;
                    GRANT EXECUTE ON DBMS_LOGMNR_D TO user;
                    GRANT SELECT ON V_$LOG TO user;
                    GRANT SELECT ON V_$LOG_HISTORY TO user;
                    GRANT SELECT ON V_$LOGMNR_LOGS TO user;
                    GRANT SELECT ON V_$LOGMNR_CONTENTS TO user;
                    GRANT SELECT ON V_$LOGMNR_PARAMETERS TO user;
                    GRANT SELECT ON V_$LOGFILE TO user;
                    GRANT SELECT ON V_$ARCHIVED_LOG TO user;
                    GRANT SELECT ON V_$ARCHIVE_DEST_STATUS TO user;
                    GRANT SELECT ON V_$TRANSACTION TO user;
