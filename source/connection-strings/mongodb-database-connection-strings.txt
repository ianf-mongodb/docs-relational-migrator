To start a migration job, Relational Migrator must connect to your MongoDB 
database. Relational Migrator requires a username and password which has ``readWrite`` 
access in the target database. This page describes 
the procedure to make a authenticated user account and the Uniform Resource 
Identifier (URI) formats for defining connections to your target 
MongoDB database. 

Relational Migrator can use both Atlas and On-Premises URIs. This page 
provides separate instructions for each deployment type.

Atlas
-----

Connect to Your Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To provision user accounts in Atlas you will need to be 
`logged in to the Atlas GUI <https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/>`__.

Create a New User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


#. In the Security section of the left navigation, click **Database Access**.
#. Click the **Add New Database User** button.
#. On the **Add New Database User** modal in the **Authentication Method** section: 
#. Select **Password** as the authentication method.
#. Enter the username ``migrator-service`` in the top text field.
#. Enter the password ``password`` in the lower text field.
#. Under **Database User Privileges**, click **Add Built-in Role**.

#  Select **Read and write to any database**.
#. Click **Add User**.

Connection URI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the previously created account credentials, format the connection
URI for the target database. In this case ``MongoEnterprises``.

.. code-block::

   mongodb+srv://migrator-service:password@sandbox.xxxxx.mongodb.net/MongoEnterprises

On-Premises
-----------

In this example, you will use mongosh to provision a user account that will connect 
to the ``MongoEnterprises`` database.

This examples assume your deployment is running on ``localhost`` and the 
default port of ``27017``.

Connect to Your Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When connecting to your deployment with mongosh, use a user account 
which has the :ref:`createRole <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.createRole/>`__
permissions in both the ``admin`` and ``MongoEnterprises`` databases.

Copy the following code with your admin credentials into a terminal to 
connect to your deployment with ``mongosh``.

.. code-block::

   mongosh "mongodb://myadminuser:myadminpassword@localhost:27017/admin"

For details on ``mongosh`` connections see : 
`Connecting to your MongoDB Deployment <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/connect/>`__.

Create a new User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In ``mongosh`` run the following command to create a 
user in the ``admin`` database:

.. code-block::

   use admin

      db.createUser(
         { user: "migrator-service",
            pwd: "password",

            roles:[{role: "readWrite" , db:"MongoEnterprises"}]
         }
      )

Create the same user in the user in the ``MongoEnterprises`` database:

.. code-block::

   use MongoEnterprises

      db.createUser(
         { user: "migrator-service",
            pwd: "password",
            roles:[{role: "readWrite" , db:"MongoEnterprises"}]
         }
      )

These commands:

- Creates new a user ``migrator-service`` with the password ``password`` in the ``admin`` and ``MongoEnterprises`` databases.
- Apply the ``readWrite`` system role to the ``MongoEnterprises`` database for the user ``migrator-service``.

Connection URI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the previously created account credentials, format the connection
URI for the target database. In this case ``MongoEnterprises``.

.. code-block::

   mongodb://migrator-service:password@localhost:27017/MongoEnterprises

Where do I use the MongoDB URI?
-------------------------------

The MongoDB connection URIs are optionally specified as part of the process for
creating a new project and a sync job.
