==================
Connection Strings
==================

Relational Migrator uses connection strings to connect to both 
the relational and MongoDB databases. You can create connection strings:

- Using the UI when you create a project.
- Using the UI when you create a sync job.
- By Manually providing the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).

To learn how to manually create your connection string URIs, see:
