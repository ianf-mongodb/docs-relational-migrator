To enable CDC at the database level
use the ``sys.sp_cdc_enable_db`` stored procedure. 

Enabling CDC generates a small number of system tables in the 
database, leaving user tables unchanged and does not add any 
performance overhead. Enabling CDC alone does not result in 
changes being captured.

The code block below is a sample of the code 
automatically-generated by Relational Migrator. 
You can run the code manually by replacing the 
database name for ``MyDB``:

.. code-block:: sql
   :copyable: false

   USE MyDB
   GO
   EXEC sys.sp_cdc_enable_db
   GO
